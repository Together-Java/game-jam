# Together Java Game Jam Repository

This repository is an archive of the games created by the Together Java community during various game jam events.

## Repository Structure

* The folders in the root directory are named by the date the game jam started (mm-yyyy).
* Inside each of those folders are subfolders named after the Discord usernames of the participants.
* Each participant folder contains the files, source code, and/or ZIP submissions for their project.

Feel free to explore, play, and learn from each project!

## How to Run a Game

Since each game may be structured slightly differently:

1. Navigate to the game's folder.
2. Read its specific `README.md` (if available).
3. Follow the setup and run instructions provided there.

Most games are built using Java, so you may need:

* Java JDK (version specified in each project, if applicable)
* An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
